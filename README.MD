## 🌐 About'em
Here in this repo is where all of my mods source code will reside. To keep track of them and in case I go dum dum and "accidentaly" delete my project folder containing all of my precious work.
You can use this repo to get inspiration and learn about codding a mod in Subnautica (code its not pretty though). And thats it, look at the code, leave or whatever.
